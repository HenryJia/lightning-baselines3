Welcome to Lightning-Baselines3 docs - Reliable and Modular Reinforcement Learning Implementations
==================================================================================================

`Lightning Baselines3 (LB3) <https://github.com/HenryJia/lightning-baselines3>`_ is a set of reliable and modular implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms built on top of PyTorch Lightning. It is adapted from `Stable Baselines3 (SB3) <https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3>`_

Github repository: https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3

Main Features
--------------

Implemented

- Unified structure for all algorithms
- Tests, high code coverage and type hints
- Modular, flexible and clean code in line with the `Lightning Philosophy <https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning#lightning-philosophy>`_


Coming Soon

- PEP8 compliant (unified code style)
- Documented functions and classes
- **The performance of each algorithm was tested** (see *Results* section in their respective page)
