WARNING: Lightning Baselines3 is currently in a very early alpha version. It's not finished by any means, and there will be breaking changes before 1.0 is released
# Lightning Baselines3

Lightning Baselines3 (LB3) is a set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms built on top of PyTorch Lightning. It is adapted from Stable Baselines3

Lightning baselines3 is designed to be a simpler, cleaner, and faster adaption of Stable Baselines through using PyTorch Lightning. It is designed to work with PyTorch Lightning v1.1.0 to allow fast and reproducible training of RL algorithms on Gym style environments.

Note: despite its simplicity of use, Lightning Baselines3 assumes you have some knowledge about Reinforcement Learning (RL). You should not utilize this library without some practice.
